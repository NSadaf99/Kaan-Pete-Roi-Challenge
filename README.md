# Kaan-Pete-Roi-Challenge
For this challenge, I had to write a program that:
1. Reads the given CSV file
2. Finds all the nodes and their connections
3. Stores the graph representation (nodes and connections) in a suitable data structure
4. Writes the outputs in a CSV file in the given format

Instructions:
Run the html code and upload any csv file or the volunteer_attendance_data file included. The output file is automatically downloaded. Output contains the connected nodes and their weights.
